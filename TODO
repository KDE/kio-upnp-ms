Support arbitrary browsing. If user directly
goes to upnp-ms://uuid/path/to/file, then use
Browse() or Search() to resolve the right ID.
 - Backtrack along the path until we get an ID,
   then call recursive Browse() with only dc:title in
   the filter (to reduce the transfer) and get the right
   ID?
