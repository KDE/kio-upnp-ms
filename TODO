HOW DO YOU?
watch for signals from cagibi about device
disconnections
be ready to update device info if it changes

when there is no event loop!
If we keep the internal event loop always
running, that will block the slave itself.

An alternative is to always keep these signals connected
so that whenever the event loop runs, we can watch
for changes, and when it isn't running, not do so.

The problem with storing update hash mappings to
only directories we have browsed before is the
following.

stat() will launch another upnp-ms slave with no shared
history. Which means only the path passed to stat()
along with ?checkupdate=1 will be checked for updates.
There has to be a way to map any ID to a path.
 -- Use the parentId attribute from the DIDL reply
 -- and walk backwards just like we walk forwards
 -- when resolving paths to objects.
