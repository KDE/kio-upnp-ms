The problem with storing update hash mappings to
only directories we have browsed before is the
following.

There has to be a way to map any ID to a path.
 -- Use the parentId attribute from the DIDL reply
 -- and walk backwards just like we walk forwards
 -- when resolving paths to objects.

Handle returnValue() errors.
Have some kind of retry when a invocation fails.
Just like TCP does. If the call fails, try after a
delay,
then double delay and so on until a certain limit
then give up. This might fix CDSs like MediaTomb.

TODO

* Support Search() with a decent syntax
