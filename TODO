HOW DO YOU?
watch for signals from cagibi about device
disconnections
be ready to update device info if it changes

when there is no event loop!
If we keep the internal event loop always
running, that will block the slave itself.

An alternative is to always keep these signals connected
so that whenever the event loop runs, we can watch
for changes, and when it isn't running, not do so.

* Support Search() with a decent syntax
