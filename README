kio-upnp-ms: KIO slave to access UPnP MediaServers
==================================================

This KIO slave enables KDE applications to access
files over the UPnP MediaServer protocol. It currently
supports both Browse and Search operations depending on
what the server supports.

The protocol is "upnp-ms://<uuid>"

where UUID is the UUID of the MediaServer device without the "uuid:" prefix.

Installation
------------

Dependencies:
* HUpnp - http://www.herqq.org
    HUpnp is a library under development, kio-upnp-ms works against
    Subversion revision 55. Although HUpnp has had a 0.6 release, the library
    has changed significantly after that and the svn version is required.

1) Install HUpnp
2) Download kio-upnp-ms
  a)  As a package
  b) Clone from git://gitorious.org/kio-upnp-ms/mainline.git
3) Unpack the archive
4) cd kio-upnp-ms
5) mkdir build && cd build
6) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr  ../
   You may have to replace /usr with the path where KDE is installed
7) make && su -c 'make install'

Usage
-----

The slave is used just like any other KIO slave, usually launched via a Job.
For search API, please see the file controlpointthread.h which includes detailed documentation.

The slave will listen to updates from the devices it is connected too. It spawns a separate thread
which keeps running and will notify of updates using OrgKdeKDirNotifyInterface over D-BUS.

The slave is capable of multiplexing, that is, one slave can handle connections to multiple MediaServers
and can check for updates from all of them. But it does so serially due to the nature of slaves. To use multiple
devices parallely, it is better to use KIO::Scheduler::getConnectedSlave() and the like. For a full example
